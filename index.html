      My name is Jonathan Kelly and I'm a web developer/software engineer (entry-level). <br>
      I currently live in Toronto with the legal right to work in both the US and Canada. <br>
      On this site you'll find a few things about my work experience, examples of projects I've worked on and my contact information.  <br>
      Feel free to reach out if you have any exciting opportunities that you think I may be able to add value to.  Cheers.
