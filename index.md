# Hi!  Welcome to my page.  Glad to have you.

My name is Jonathan Kelly and I'm a web developer/software engineer (entry-level). I currently live in Toronto with the legal right to work in both the US and Canada. On this site you'll find a few things about my work experience, examples of projects I've worked on and my contact information.  Feel free to reach out if you have any exciting opportunities that you think I may be able to add value to.  Cheers.''''
